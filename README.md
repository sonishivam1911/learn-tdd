# JEST tutorial for test-driven development
Learn how to write unit tests and other kinds of tests

# Setup

Install dependencies

`$ npm install`

Run tests

`$ NODE_ENV=test npx jest /path/to/test/file`

Run coverage

`$ NODE_ENV=test npx jest --coverage /path/to/test/file`

View coverage report in `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

**Windows Note**: If you are on Windows and the above commands do not run
because of NODE_ENV not recognized then first set the environment variable from the terminal using `SET NODE_ENV=test` and then
run the jest command `npx jest --covereage /path/to/test/file`. The coverage is optional.

The followung database scripts are not necessary. If you still need
them for manual testing here they are:

`$ npx ts-node insert_sample_data.ts "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/my_library_db"`

Clean the database

`npx ts-node remove_db.ts "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/my_library_db"`

# Description

This repository illustrates how to use jest to write unit tests 
for a server in typescript. The examples are as follows:

- `tests/authorSchema.test.ts`: Unit tests to verify the schema of the authors colletion. 
- `tests/bookDetailsService.test.ts`: Unit tests to verify the behavior of the service that is used to retrieve the details of a particular book.
- `tests/createBookService.test.ts`: Unit tests to verify if a book is created successfully.

# For you to do

## Part 1

Write a unit test for the GET /authors service. 
The service should respond with a list of author names and lifetimes sorted by family name of the authors. It should respond
with a "No authors found" message when there are no authors in the database. If an error occurs when retrieving the authors then the
service responds with an error code of 500. The unit test
should be placed in `tests/authorService.test.ts`.

## Part 2

Briefly explain a limitation of the tests in `tests/authorSchema.test.ts` in the space below.

One limitation is that our tests are closely tied to the current implementation of our model. If we modify the internal workings of the model, such as switching the Mongoose methods used, we would also need to update and maintain the tests. This tight coupling exists because we are mocking the internal Mongoose methods within the model functions, making the tests dependent on these specific implementations.

## Part 3

Generate the coverage report for the tests you wrote. How can you improve
your tests using the coverage report? Briefly explain your 
process in the space below.


To enhance our test coverage and achieve better results in the coverage report, we should write additional tests that cover all possible conditions and outcomes. Ensuring that every line of code is executed when a function is called is key to increasing the coverage percentage. This includes testing all branches of if/else statements, making it an effective way to improve overall test coverage.
